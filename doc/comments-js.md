# Comments for ChilliSource Javascript frameworks #

Please follow the commenting guidelines below:

* add a summary comment for each public type (classes, structs, interfaces, enums)
* add a summary comment for each public method that is not trivial and self-explanatory and describe the following as relevant:
    * purpose
    * usage
    * expected behaviours
    * hidden behaviours
    * any other important considerations.	
* add a comment to specify default values of properties
* add a comment to complex internal code describing purpose
* consider refactoring internal code that requires comments to make the code more clear
* prefer explaining the 'why' instead of the 'what' of the code
